# THOR-APP
This iOS App is part of a senior design project in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering at Boston University. The app will enable a DJI Phantom 3 Pro drone to semi-autonomously navigate a wheat crop field, capture images and process images in the cloud with an NDVI algorithm. The final output will be a color coded NDVI map of the wheat field useful for wheat farmers. The image storage and image processing will be done in the AWS cloud. The project is tailored to the customer's requirements, Graminor, in Norway.
